--- ### list2cons

list2cons :: [a] -> List a
list2cons [] = Nil
list2cons (x:xs) = Cons x (list2cons xs)

--- ### cons2list

cons2list :: List a -> [a]
cons2list Nil = []
cons2list (Cons x xs) = x : cons2list xs

--- ### eval

eval :: Exp -> Integer
eval (IntExp n) = n
eval (PlusExp xs) = sum (map eval xs)
eval (MultExp xs) = product (map eval xs)

--- ### list2cons'

list2cons' :: [a] -> List a
list2cons' = foldr Cons Nil

--- ### BinTree

data BinTree a = Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
  | Leaf
  deriving (Show)


--- ### sumTree

sumTree :: Num a => BinTree a -> a
sumTree Leaf = 0
sumTree (Node x l r) = x + sumTree l + sumTree r

--- ### SimpVal

data SimpVal = 
    IntVal  Integer
  | BoolVal Bool
  | StrVal  String
  | ExnVal  String
  deriving (Show)

--- ### liftIntOp

liftIntOp :: (Integer -> Integer -> Integer) -> SimpVal -> SimpVal -> SimpVal
liftIntOp op (IntVal x ) (IntVal y) = IntVal (op x y )
liftIntOp _ _ _ = ExnVal "not an IntVal!"
